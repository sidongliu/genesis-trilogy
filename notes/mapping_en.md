## Master Key: The Four Aspects ↔ Four-Part Structure Theorem

| Yogacara Aspect | Framework Counterpart | Source | Mathematical Object |
|-----------------|----------------------|--------|-------------------|
| **Nimitta-bhaga** (Image/Appearance) | External observable geometry | HAFF | Accessible algebra A_c ⊂ B(H_U), emergent metric g_μν |
| **Darsana-bhaga** (Perception) | Internal control algebra | Q-RAIF | Cl(V,q) ↪ Cl(1,3) |
| **Svasamvitti** (Self-witnessing) | Lyapunov self-monitoring | T-DOME III | V(σ), dV/dt ≤ 0 |
| **Svasamvitti-samvitti** (Witnessing the witness) | Structural incompleteness | HAFF Paper G | Framework cannot self-ground (theorem) |

Yogacara holds that the four aspects nest progressively, and the fourth cannot witness itself. Paper G proves exactly this — the fourth layer is a provably unreachable boundary.

## Part I: HAFF ↔ Nimitta-bhaga (Appearance / Heaven-Realm)

### Core Correspondence: Accessible Algebra = Dharma

| Theory Term | Mathematical Object | Yogacara Counterpart | Note |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|------|
| Global quantum state \|Ψ⟩ ∈ H_U | State vector in Hilbert space | **Tathata** (suchness) / **Ekacitta** (one mind) | The ground of all; undifferentiated, structureless |
| Coarse-graining | Selection of subalgebra A_c ⊂ B(H_U) | **Vikalpa** (discrimination) | The first cut — from undifferentiated to differentiated |
| Accessible algebra A_c | *-subalgebra | **Dharma** | Everything that can be observed |
| Inaccessible complement B(H_U) \ A_c | Complement algebra | **Asamskrta-dharma** (unconditioned) / ineffable | Unobservable under current coarse-graining |
| Inequivalent coarse-grainings | Different choices of A_c | **Nihsvabhava** (no self-nature of dharmas) | Same \|Ψ⟩, different discrimination, different "worlds" |

### Emergence Processes ↔ Container-World Genesis

| Process | Mathematics | Yogacara Counterpart | Note |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|------|
| Algebra → Topology | Spectrum of A_c → point-set topology | **Paratantra-svabhava** (dependent nature) | Geometry is not self-existing; it arises dependent on algebra |
| Topology → Geometry | Entanglement structure → effective metric | **Bhajana-loka** (container world) | Space emerges from correlations |
| Gravity | Evolution of the algebra itself | **Vivarta** (formation-abiding-decay-emptiness) | Not motion within geometry, but geometry itself changing |
| Measurement | Redundancy selection within algebra | **Pratyaksa** (direct perception) | Not collapse, but selection within existing structure |
| Classical emergence | Information redundancy → pointer states | **Samanya** (universal/shared appearance) | Multiple observers see the same "classical world" |
| Arrow of time | Statistical gradient of redundancy R(O) | **Ksana** (moments) accumulating into temporal flow | Time is not a fundamental parameter but an emergent partial order |

### Key Formula Mappings

| Formula | Meaning | Yogacara Counterpart |
|---------|---------|---------------------|
| A_c = ⟨O₁, O₂, ...⟩ | Observables generate algebra | Triple conjunction of root-dust-consciousness (indriya-visaya-vijnana) |
| ρ_A = Tr_Ā(ρ) | Partial trace over inaccessible part | Discarding the unconditioned; retaining only conditioned dharmas |
| I(A:B) > 0 | Entanglement between subsystems | Pratityasamutpada — all dharmas arise from correlations |
| R(O) monotonically increasing | Redundancy expansion | Samskara — the driving force pushing time forward |
| Paper G: framework cannot self-ground | Incompleteness theorem | **Svasamvitti-samvitti is unreachable** |

### Paper G: The Deep Mapping

Paper G proves: any description based on accessible algebras cannot derive its own first coarse-graining.

This precisely corresponds to the core Yogacara dilemma: **consciousness cannot cognise the origin of consciousness.** Dignaga's four-aspect theory stops at svasamvitti-samvitti precisely because going further is epistemologically impossible. Paper G turns this "impossibility" into a mathematical theorem.

## Part II: Q-RAIF ↔ Darsana-bhaga (Perception / Earth-Realm)

### Core Correspondence: Control Algebra = Perceiving Consciousness

| Theory Term | Mathematical Object | Yogacara Counterpart | Note |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|------|
| Persistent subsystem | Non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) | **Sattva** (sentient being) | A system that can sustain itself = a sentient being |
| Internal control algebra O_int | Cl(V,q) | **Darsana-bhaga** (perceiving aspect) | The algebraic structure of the observer's capacity to "see" |
| Environmental algebra A_ext | Cl(1,3) | **Nimitta-bhaga** (appearance aspect) | The algebraic structure of the seen world |
| Realizability embedding φ | Cl(V,q) ↪ Cl(1,3) | **Darsana depends on nimitta** | The fish's gills must be built from the water's molecules |
| Algebraic natural selection | Only compatible O_int can persist | **Karmic selection** | Not all algebraic structures survive |

### Three Papers Mapped

| Q-RAIF Paper | Result | Yogacara Counterpart |
|--------------|--------|---------------------|
| Paper A (Water) | Lorentzian geometry requires Cl(1,3)-compatible boundary algebra | **Eho-funi** (non-duality of self and environment) — environment and observer algebras must be compatible |
| Paper B (Fish) | Persistence requires Clifford control algebra | **Darsana-bhaga must have specific structure to maintain santana** (continuity) |
| Paper C (Bridge) | Realizability forces O_int ↪ A_ext | **Citta does not leave visaya; visaya does not leave citta** — perceiver and perceived algebras mutually constrain |

### Key Formula Mappings

| Formula | Meaning | Yogacara Counterpart |
|---------|---------|---------------------|
| v² = q(v)·1 ∀ v ∈ V | Clifford algebra fundamental relation | Intrinsic structural law of darsana-bhaga |
| φ: Cl(V,q) ↪ Cl(1,3) | Realizability embedding | **Alambana-pratyaya** (object-condition) — darsana-bhaga is constrained by nimitta-bhaga's structure |
| dim V = n, D = 2ⁿ | Generators vs multivector space | A few root seeds generate vast possible states |
| Lyapunov stability condition | NESS maintenance | **Santana** (continuity) — conditions for the sentient being's continued existence |

### The Yogacara Significance of 3+1 Dimensions

Why do we observe in 3+1 dimensions?

Q-RAIF's answer: because only Cl(1,3)-compatible observers can persist.

Yogacara structural counterpart: **Shared karma** (samanya-karma) — we see the same 3+1-dimensional world not because it "inherently" is 3+1-dimensional, but because beings that persist in this algebraic structure necessarily share this observation.

## Part III: T-DOME ↔ Vijnana (Consciousness / Human-Realm)

### Paper I (Seed / Alaya-vijnana)

#### Core Correspondence: Memory Kernel = Seed

| Theory Term | Mathematical Object | Yogacara Counterpart | Note |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|------|
| Memory kernel K(t,s) | Nakajima-Zwanzig superoperator | **Bija** (seed) | The influence of past on present |
| Non-Markovian dynamics | ρ̇(t) = ∫K(t,s)ρ(s)ds | **Alaya-vijnana** | The consciousness carrying all seeds |
| Information backflow | D(ρ₁,ρ₂) temporarily increases | **Bija → pravṛtti** (seed → manifestation) | Stored correlations return to the present |
| Markovian limit | K(t,s) → K₀δ(t-s) | **Momentary arising-ceasing without memory** | Each moment forgets the last |
| Survival functional S | ΔF - W | **Karma** | Free energy gain minus cost = net karma |
| System-environment correlation I(S:E) | Mutual information | **Bija-sakti** (seed-power) | A consumable thermodynamic resource |
| Entropy rate h_μ | lim T⁻¹ H(X_{0:T}) | **The cost of avidya** (ignorance) | The ongoing cost of environmental unpredictability |
| Predictive information I_pred | I(past; future) | **Prajna** (wisdom) / **vidya** (knowledge) | The predictive power of the past about the future |

#### Key Formula Mappings

| Formula | Meaning | Yogacara Counterpart |
|---------|---------|---------------------|
| S ≤ 0 (Markovian Ceiling) | No memory → no thermodynamic profit | **Beings trapped in ignorance cannot escape samsara** — no accumulation → no transcendence |
| βS = -ΔI(S:E) - ΔD_KL | Survival = consuming correlations + bath displacement | **Karma arises from pratityasamutpada** — karma comes from changes in correlation with environment |
| S > 0 when ΔI < 0 | Consuming pre-existing correlations yields profit | **Wholesome karma matures** — past good causes bear present fruit |
| Ẇ_mem ≥ kT ln2 · h_μ | Landauer cost of memory maintenance | **The cost of maintaining seeds** — alaya-vijnana requires energy to sustain itself |
| Memory Catastrophe | Ẇ_mem > Ẇ_budget → collapse | **Infinite seed accumulation** → filtering needed (motivates manas) |

#### Key Process Mappings

| Process | Physical Process | Yogacara Process |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Seed → Manifestation | K(t,s) acts on ρ(s) → influences ρ(t) | Bija matures into pravṛtti |
| Manifestation → Seed | Current state updates I(S:E) | Pravṛtti perfumes new bija (vasana) |
| Information backflow | Environment returns previously absorbed information | Vipaka — past karma returns |
| Memory accumulation | τ_mem grows | Santana — continuous stream of alaya-vijnana |

### Paper II (Ego / Manas)

#### Core Correspondence: Symmetry Breaking = Self-Grasping

| Theory Term | Mathematical Object | Yogacara Counterpart | Note |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|------|
| Automorphism group G = Aut(Cl(V,q)) | Gauge symmetry | **Samata** (equality) — before breaking, all equivalent | No self-grasping → no foreground/background distinction |
| Spontaneous symmetry breaking | Selection of privileged basis | **Atma-graha** (self-grasping) | The transition from equality to inequality |
| Ego E = (F*, V*_fg) | Gauge fixing + foreground subspace | **Manas** (self-consciousness) | The mathematical structure of "I" |
| Foreground V_fg | k*-dimensional subspace | **Atmiya** (what belongs to self) | That which is attended to |
| Background V_bg | (D-k*)-dimensional complement | **Anatmiya** (what does not belong to self) | That which is ignored |
| k* = C_budget/h_μ | Optimal retained dimensions | **The size of self-grasping is determined by computation and ignorance** | More computation or more predictable environment → larger self |
| Computational Ceiling | Symmetric processing → paralysis in finite time | **No self-grasping + infinite memory = paralysis** | Without discrimination, processing is impossible |

#### Four Bias Terms ↔ Four Afflictions of Manas

This is the most precise one-to-one correspondence in the entire mapping:

| Bias Term | Mathematical Definition | Manas Affliction | Note |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------------|------|
| B_select (basis selection) | Chose V_fg over V_bg | **Atma-drsti** (self-view) | "This is me" — chose a perspective |
| B_frame (frame drag) | Reference frame bias from gauge fixing | **Atma-mana** (self-pride) | "My perspective is correct" — rigidity of the reference frame |
| B_center (objective centering) | Objective function centred on self | **Atma-sneha** (self-love) | "What's good for me is good" — self-centredness of the objective |
| B_inc (model incompleteness) | Information lost after compression | **Atma-moha** (self-delusion) | "What I see is all there is" — ignorance of own limitations |

#### Key Formula Mappings

| Formula | Meaning | Yogacara Counterpart |
|---------|---------|---------------------|
| R ≥ h_μ · D (Computational Ceiling) | Symmetric processing rate scales with dimension | No discrimination → cannot keep up → suffering |
| τ_par = C_budget/(h_μ · D) | Paralysis time | How long one can last without discrimination |
| k* = ⌊C_budget/h_μ⌋ | Optimal foreground dimension | The optimal scale of self-grasping — too small is blind, too large is paralysed |
| S = S_vis(F) + S_hid(F) | Survival = visible part + hidden part | Karma I know about + karma I don't know about |
| θ(t) = θ₀ e^{Λt} | Frame mismatch grows exponentially | **Dharma-grasping grows** — the more you cling, the more you deviate |
| t_del = Λ⁻¹ ln(π/4θ₀) | Delusion time | **Time until jneyavarana matures** — beyond this point, the ego's bias becomes irreparable |

#### Delusion Trap ↔ Jneyavarana (Cognitive Obstruction)

Paper II's final theorem — the Delusion Trap — precisely corresponds to Yogacara's **jneyavarana** (cognitive obstruction):

- **Jneyavarana is not not-knowing; it is that the very mode of knowing is itself the obstruction**
- The Delusion Trap is not lack of information but the reference frame itself preventing the agent from detecting its own deviation
- Three simultaneous catastrophes: hidden survival component dominates, update direction reverses, all four biases operate within the foreground
- Yogacara says: the four afflictions of manas cannot be observed by manas itself — this requires the higher-level svasamvitti

---

### Paper III (Loop / Svasamvitti)

#### Core Correspondence: Fisher Information = Self-Witnessing

| Theory Term | Mathematical Object | Yogacara Counterpart | Note |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|------|
| Prediction residual e(t) | S_vis - S_vis^pred | **Vedana** (feeling-tone) | Not truth itself, but the gap between prediction and outcome |
| Residual distribution p(e\|σ) | Distribution conditioned on frame parameters | **Vedana-skandha** (aggregate of feeling) | The statistical properties of feeling |
| Fisher information g_ij(σ) | Sensitivity of residual distribution to σ | **Svasamvitti** (self-witnessing) | Not observing the world, but observing one's own observation |
| Fisher information spike | g_ij increases | **Awareness of duhkha** | Svasamvitti detects deviation — "something is wrong" |
| Lyapunov function V(σ) | Measure of frame mismatch | **Smrti** (mindfulness) | Continuously monitoring "how far off am I" |
| dV/dt ≤ 0 | Lyapunov decrease | **Efficacy of mindfulness** | Monitoring does reduce deviation |
| Natural gradient descent | σ̇ = -η g⁻¹(σ) ∇S | **Samyak-prayama** (right effort) | Correcting along the steepest direction in information geometry |
| Recalibration | Update σ → σ_new | **Bhavana** (cultivation/practice) | Adjusting one's own reference frame |
| Drift detection | I_F(σ) grows quadratically | **Awareness of the cause of duhkha** | Knowing that deviation is accumulating |

#### Key Formula Mappings

| Formula | Meaning | Yogacara Counterpart |
|---------|---------|---------------------|
| g_ij(σ) = E[∂log p/∂σⁱ · ∂log p/∂σʲ] | Fisher information matrix | **Mathematical definition of svasamvitti** — sensitivity to one's own cognitive state |
| Var(σ̂) ≥ 1/(n_eff · I_F + I_ego) | Self-Referential Cramer-Rao bound | **Lower bound on avidya** — self-correction has an irreducible precision limit |
| Ẇ_loop ≥ kT ln2 [h_μk* + C_meta] + L²/τ²_recalib | Thermodynamic cost of calibration loop | **The cost of practice** — self-monitoring is never free |
| dV/dt ≤ -α\|∇V\|² + β·ε | Lyapunov tracking bound | **Practice can track but cannot eliminate duhkha** — as long as drift ε exists, V > 0 |
| I_F ~ O(Λ²t²) | Fisher information grows quadratically | **Rate of duhkha accumulation** — without practice, suffering accelerates |

#### Key Process Mappings

| Process | Physical Process | Yogacara Process |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Drift → residual shift | Environment changes → e(t) distribution shifts | Visaya turns → vedana changes |
| Residual → Fisher information | Observing statistical properties of e(t) | From vedana-skandha, becoming aware of duhkha |
| Fisher → gradient | Computing ∇_σ S | From awareness of duhkha to understanding its cause |
| Gradient → recalibration | σ → σ - η g⁻¹∇S | From understanding to correction — samyak-prayama |
| Recalibration → new residual | New σ changes e(t) distribution | Practice changes vedana — but does not eliminate it |

#### Three Cost Components ↔ Three Trainings

| Cost Component | Physical Meaning | Yogacara Counterpart |
|----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| h_μ k* (sensing cost) | Landauer cost of maintaining foreground subspace | **Sila** (ethical discipline) — the basic discipline of maintaining awareness |
| C_meta (computation cost) | Information rate of meta-level processing | **Samadhi** (concentration) — the focused effort of computing one's own state |
| L²/τ²_recalib (actuation cost) | Thermodynamic length of frame update | **Prajna** (wisdom) — the cost of actually changing oneself |

## Part IV: The Logic Chain ↔ Twelve Links (Structural Mapping)

T-DOME's "medicine-and-poison" chain is structurally isomorphic (not content-identical) to the twelve nidanas:

| Chain Link | T-DOME | Twelve Nidanas Counterpart | Structural Note |
|-----------|--------|--------------------------|----------------|
| Starting point | Global quantum state \|Ψ⟩ | Avidya (ignorance) | The unknowable starting point |
| First cut | Coarse-graining selection | Samskara (formations) | The first volitional act |
| Emergent geometry | HAFF → spacetime | Vijnana → namarupa → sadayatana | World and sense-bases emerge |
| Memory formation | T-DOME I: K(t,s) accumulates | Sparsa → vedana → trsna | Contact → feeling → craving |
| Self formation | T-DOME II: SSB → ego | Upadana → bhava | Grasping → becoming |
| Self rigidification | Delusion Trap | Jati → jaramarana | Birth → ageing and death |
| Self calibration | T-DOME III: Fisher loop | — (beyond the twelve links) | The twelve links have no counterpart — this is the path of liberation |

Key difference: the twelve nidanas are a closed cycle of samsara; T-DOME's Paper III opens an exit (the self-calibration loop), but Paper G proves this exit cannot lead to complete liberation — only tracking, never elimination.

This corresponds to the Mahayana insight: **klesa is bodhi** (affliction is awakening) — bias cannot be eliminated, but it can be monitored and compensated in real time. Nirvana is not the destruction of affliction but not being dragged by it.

## Part VI: Deepest Structural Correspondences

### Three Natures ↔ Three Framework Layers

| Yogacara Three Natures | Definition | Framework Counterpart |
|------------------------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Parikalpita-svabhava** (imagined nature) | What ordinary beings grasp as real | The ego's four biases — grasping one's own reference frame as "true" |
| **Paratantra-svabhava** (dependent nature) | Arises from causes and conditions | All emergent structure — geometry, observers, self |
| **Parinispanna-svabhava** (perfected nature) | Seeing dependent nature as it is | Fisher information calibration — knowing that bias is bias, without grasping "no-bias" |

### Medicine and Poison ↔ Klesa is Bodhi

| Layer | Medicine (resolves previous crisis) | Poison (creates next crisis) |
|-------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Memory | Breaks the Markovian trap → accumulation becomes possible | Infinite memory → computational collapse |
| Self | Breaks computational paralysis → selection becomes possible | Fixed bias → Delusion Trap |
| Calibration | Breaks the Delusion Trap → tracking becomes possible | Calibration itself has an irreducible cost |

Each layer's medicine is the next layer's poison. This precisely corresponds to the core Mahayana insight: **klesa is bodhi, samsara is nirvana** — not eliminating affliction (impossible, Paper G) but tracking affliction in real time (Paper III).

### "Mind Can Cognise Mind, as a Lamp Illuminates Itself"

Paper III's Fisher-information calibration loop has the mathematical structure: **the system uses its own prediction residuals to estimate its own frame parameters.**

This precisely corresponds to Dignaga's dictum: **citta can cognise citta, as a lamp illuminates itself** — mind does not need an external object to illuminate itself, just as a lamp does not need another lamp to be seen.

Mathematical translation: Fisher information g_ij(σ) is computed entirely from residuals e(t) within V_fg, without any access to V_bg. The system uses its own output to calibrate its own input — as a lamp illuminates itself.

### Cannot Self-Ground ↔ Avyakrta (The Unanswerable)

Paper G proves that the framework cannot derive its own starting point. This corresponds to how Buddhism handles the "first cause" problem:

- Not answering "what is the first cause" (that is theology)
- Not saying "there is no first cause" (that is nihilism)
- But proving that **the question "what is the first cause" has no meaning within the framework** (that is Madhyamaka)

Paper G's theorem is the mathematisation of avyakrta (the unanswerable). The Buddha's silence on the fourteen unanswerable questions was not ignorance of the answer but recognition that the questions themselves exceed the boundary of epistemology. Paper G proves where that boundary is.
